            I decide it's time for a new phone and just in time as well, as my
            old phone was really dying. It was a

            First Cyanogen died, then I swapped to stock android, then updates
            dried up... Also the USB connection had given up, I used SShelper to
            transfer data for maybe years, now it was refusing to charge without
            the aid of blutac. So 5 years use, not bad!

            First I thought <b>fairphone</b>, but the price was too much, so I
            looked at the <b>ubports</b> site and decided to get an old phone:
            The Nexus 5, seemed good for this. So christmas day I had one... a
            <b>Nexus 5X</b>, which is apparently not the same, I needed
            hammerhead, I had bullhead... Oh well LineageOS will work with my
            new phone. A little intimidating as my new phone, felt really good,
            but wasn't getting updates so it had to be done. Here is what
            happended:
